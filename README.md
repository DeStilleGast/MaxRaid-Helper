# MaxRaid-Helper
This was a bot for a specific server but the mods of the server thinks that the bot will be useless, some other people including myself have other thought.

# Things this bot can do
- Load pokemon names from Sword and Shield pokedex (name and dex number)
- Lazy load effectiveness of a pokemon
- parse a reddit thread if given

All the information is loaded from serebii and cached to prevent multiple spamming calls to there site

side note:
The bot was denied and so this is the reason to drop the project for now and might contain unused/not optimized code, you can use it however you want, but please give credits.
